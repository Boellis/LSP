  description: "Jesse Lee Bond was lynched in Arlington,Tennessee on April 28, 1939
    \u2013 in broad daylight, on the town square. The authorities lied about it,
    and the newspapers remained silent. It took more than seven decades, but Jesse
    Lee Bond's 96-year-old brother, Charle Morris, finally succeeded, through persistence
    and faith, in bringing this murder to light."
